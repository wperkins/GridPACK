This is a sample CMake project that uses PETSc and Boost MPI. In it's
current state, this project assumes that PETSc and Boost were both
built with the same MPI compiler set and that compiler set is
available.  This should actually be checked somehow.  

PETSc needs to be built with MPI and complex support and using
C++. The important PETSc configuration options are

    --with-mpi=1
    --with-scalar-type=complex
    --with-clanguage=c++

When these options are used, it appears that blas/lapack need to be
built from scratch, so these options also need to be used:

    --download-f2cblaslapack=1

Here is an example configuration that works on my Mac:

    setenv PETSC_DIR /net/flophouse/files0/perksoft/petsc-3.3-p3
    unsetenv PETSC_ARCH 
    python ./config/configure.py \
        --with-prefix=/net/flophouse/files0/perksoft/macosx \
        --with-mpi=1 \
        --with-cc=openmpicc \
        --with-fc=openmpif90 \
        --with-cxx=openmpicxx \
        --with-c++-support=1 \
        --with-c-support=0 \
        --with-fortran=0 \
        --with-scalar-type=complex \
        --download-f2cblaslapack=1 \
        --with-clanguage=c++ \
        --with-shared-libraries=0 \
        --with-dynamic-loading=0 \
        --with-x=0 \
        --with-mpirun=openmpirun \
        --with-mpiexec=openmpiexec \
        --with-debugging=0


To build the sample program(s), modify conf.sh to suit your
PETSc/Boost installation,
and do this:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    sh ../conf.sh
    make
