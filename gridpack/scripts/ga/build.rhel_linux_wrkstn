# This script has been used to build GA on a Linux workstation running RHEL 7.
# This script builds two-sided implementation of GA, which is suitable for small
# parallel jobs up to about 8-16 processors. Be sure and modify the argument of
# the --prefix option to reflect the top level directory of the GA
# distribution, which is where this script should be run. This script has been used
# with GA 5.5 but should work with other distributions above 5.4.
