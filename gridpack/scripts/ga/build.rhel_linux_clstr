# This script has been used to build GA on a Linux cluster using an Infiniband
# interconnect with OpenMPI 1.8.3 and GNU 4.9.2 compilers. This script builds
# the progress ranks implementation of GA, which is suitable for large scale
# parallel calculations. Be sure and modify the argument of the --prefix option
# to reflect the top level directory of the GA distribution, which is where this
# script should be run. This script has been used with GA 5.6 and 5.7. It should
# also work with 5.4 and 5.5 but has not been tested with them.
