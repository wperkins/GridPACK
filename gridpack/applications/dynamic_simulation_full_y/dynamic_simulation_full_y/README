Adding new models to the Dynamic Simulation module

The dynamic simulation module is designed to be easily extendible so that new
models can be added with relatively little work. To add a new device requires
the user to

1) Identify the interface that corresponds to the device. The interfaces are
   defined in the files located in the base_classes directory. The available
   interfaces include base_generator_model, base_governor_model, 
   base_exciter_model, base_relay_model, and base_load_model. The new device
   model should inherit from one of these classes. The virtual functions in
   class should be overwritten in the device impelementation. Examples of how
   to do this are available in the existing implementations in the model_classes
   directory.

2) The model needs to be added to the appropriate factory.
   Generators: add new generator class to the createGeneratorModel method in
               the generator_factory.cpp file
   Governors: add new governor class to the createGovernorModel method in
              the generator_factory.cpp file
   Exciters: add new exciter class to the createExciterModel method in the
             generator_factory.cpp file
   Relays: add new relay class to the createRelayModel method in the
           relay_factory.cpp file
   Loads: add new load model to the createLoadModel method in the
          load_factory.cpp file

3) Unfortunately, the parser for .dyr files is not complete so not all device
   models are being parsed. If you need parameters for a new device, you can
   contact the developers at gridpack.account@pnnl.gov and we will try and
   get a parser to you as soon as possible. If you are more ambitious, you can
   try adding the new parser yourself. See the README documentation in the
   src/parser directory for information on how to do this.

If you add a new device and would like to include it in the repository, feel
free to contact us at the above address and we will help you add it to the
existing suite of GridPACK models.
